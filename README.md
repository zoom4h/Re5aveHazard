This Python program allows for the modification of Resident Evil 5 v1.2.0 (Steam release) save files. It supports editing a variety of in-game values, including:

- SteamID
- Money
- Level progress
- Bonus features
- Costumes (including two normally unavailable ones)
- Weapons (again, including normally unavailable ones)

The program operates directly on the save file, ensuring no memory injection or game file corruption occurs.
